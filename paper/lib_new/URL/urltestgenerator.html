 This lacks documentation. But basically you pass in an array of tests (in cases below)
 and a common base URL and after some tweaking you get tests you can use in urltests.txt.

 With some more tweaking you can vary the base URL, too.

 Not covered by this format: testing URLs & encodings, and testing setting of properties,
 such as .host.
